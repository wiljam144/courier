Welcome to (Non)Intellectual Courier, a website that's a bank of my knowledge
about mathematics and computer science.
and a lot of other things. I styled it to mimic my geometry textbook through the
use of LaTeX's default font: Computer Modern. To navigate you can use the navbar
on the right (or if you're on mobile, use button at the top), on the left are some
useful links. If you want to return to the homepage just click the logo at the top.
Please also note that this website is not designed with mobile devices in mind,
and the custom styling so that it will not completely break down on them is
really minimal and ugly. If you find any mistakes, please contact me using the email
from linkage.
