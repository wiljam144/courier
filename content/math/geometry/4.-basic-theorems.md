# Basic Theorems

These theorems are an example of some simple deduction that can be made from axioms
defined in *[Section 3](/courier/content/math/geometry/3.-axioms.md)*.

## Theorem 4.1

***Thesis:*** Two non-parallels lines intersect at a single point.

***Proof:*** They have a single point, because they are non-parallel, if they had
more than one common point, by virtue of Axiom 3.1, they would be equal, so they
would need to be parallel.

## Theorem 4.2

***Thesis:*** If $k \parallel l$ and $m \parallel l$, then $k \parallel m$.

***Proof:*** Let's assume, that $k \nparallel m$, and that point $P$ is their
point of intersection. Then lines $k$ and $m$ are parrallel to line $l$ and
they pass through point $P$. By virtue of Axiom 3.6 they are equal, which means
they are parrallel, this contradiction proves the theorem.

## Theorem 4.3

***Thesis:*** If $l \perp m$ and $k \perp m$ then $l \parallel k$.

***Proof:*** If line $l$ was not parralel to line $k$, then by virtue of Theorem
4.1, they would have precisely one point of intersection. Denoting this point
with $P$ we can see that there exist two different lines that pass throgh $P$
and are perpendicular to line $m$, which contradicts Axiom 3.7, so $l \parallel k$.

***Thesis:*** If $\sphericalangle \alpha$ and $\sphericalangle \alpha'$ are opposite
angles, then ${|\sphericalangle \alpha| = |\sphericalangle \alpha'|}$.

***Proof:*** With notations from ^Figure 4.1^, we have:

$$
\begin{gather*}
|\sphericalangle \alpha| + |\sphericalangle \beta| = 180\degree
\land
|\sphericalangle \alpha'| + |\sphericalangle \beta| = 180\degree \\
\implies
|\sphericalangle \alpha| = |\sphericalangle \alpha'|
\end{gather*}

***Thesis:*** Corresponding & alternate angles are of equal measure.

***Proof:*** When $m \perp l$, then, by virtue of Axiom 3.8, $m \perp k$, which
means that all examined angles have measures equal $\frac{1}{2}\pi$. If $\lnot (m \perp l)$,
let $Q$ be the projection of point $B$ (which is a point of intersection of lines $l$ and $m$ )
on line $k$, and P be the projection of point $A$ (which is a point of intersection of lines $k$ and $m$ )
on line $l$. Now, two triangles $\triangle AQB$ and $\triangle BPA$ have been created.

From definition of projection of point on a line, we have $k \perp \overline{BQ}$.
This along with assumption that $k \parallel l$, by virtue of Axiom 3.8 gives us $l \perp \overline{BQ}$.
From here we can see that $B$ is a projection of point $Q$ on line $l$. At the same
time $P$ is a projection of point $A$, so by virtue of Axiom 3.9 and Axiom 3.2:

$$
|QB| = |AP| = |PA|
$$

Because both lines $BQ$ and $AP$ are parallel to line $l$, so by virtue of
Theorem 4.2, we see that $BQ \parallel AP$. On top of that $Q$ is a projection of
point $A$ on line $BQ$, and $B$ is a projection of point $P$ on the same line,
citing Axiom 3.2 and Axiom 3.9 again we have:

$$
|QA| = |AQ| = |PB|
$$

Both of these equalities and resulting from construction equality
that $|\sphericalangle AQB| = |\sphericalangle BPA| = \frac{1}{2}\pi$ give us,
by virtue of *SAS* property of congruence (Axiom 3.10), give us congruency:

$$
\triangle AQB \stackrel{SAS}{\equiv} \triangle BPA
$$

From which we have, that $|\sphericalangle AQB| = |\sphericalangle PBA|$, which
means equality of corresponding and alternating angles.
