# Basic Theorems

These theorems are an example of some simple deduction that can be made from axioms
defined in *[Section 3](/content/math/geometry/3.-axioms.md)*.

## Theorem 4.1

***Thesis:*** Two non-parallels lines intersect at a single point.

***Proof:*** They have a single point, because they are non-parallel, if they had
more than one common point, by virtue of axiom 3.1, they would be equal, so they
would need to be parallel.

*Quod Erat Demonstrandum.*

## Theorem 4.2

***Thesis:*** If $k \parallel l$ and $m \parallel l$, then $k \parallel m$.

***Proof:*** Let's assume, that $k \nparallel m$, and that point $P$ is their
point of intersection. Then lines $k$ and $m$ are parrallel to line $l$ and
they pass through point $P$. By virtue of axiom 6 they are equal, which means
they are parrallel, this contradiction proves the theorem.

***Thesis:*** If $\sphericalangle \alpha$ and $\sphericalangle \alpha'$ are opposite
angles, then ${|\sphericalangle \alpha| = |\sphericalangle \alpha'|}$.

***Proof:*** With notations from ^Figure 4.1^, we have:

$$
|\sphericalangle \alpha| + |\sphericalangle \beta| = 180\degree
\land
|\sphericalangle \alpha'| + |\sphericalangle \beta| = 180\degree
\Rightarrow
|\sphericalangle \alpha| = |\sphericalangle \alpha'|
$$
