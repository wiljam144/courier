# Geometric Shapes

**Definition 2.1** Geometric shape $\mathcal{F}$ is **convex**
when $\forall A,B \in \mathcal{F} : \overline{AB} \in \mathcal{F}$. Shown in
^Figure 1.1^.

**Definition 2.2** Point A is an **inside point** of shape $\mathcal{F}$, if there
exists a positive number $r$, such that $\mathcal{D}(A;r) \subseteq \mathcal{F}$.
Set of all inside points of shape $\mathcal{F}$ is the **inside** of $\mathcal{F}$.
Point B is an **outside point** of shape $\mathcal{F}$, where there exists a positive
number $r$, such that $\mathcal{D}(B;r) \cap \mathcal{F} = \varnothing$. C is an
**edge point** of shape $\mathcal{F}$, when for every positive number $r$, such
that both inside points and outside points are inside of a circle $\mathcal{D}(C;r)$.
A set of all edge points of $\mathcal{F}$ is the edge of $\mathcal{F}$.

I will also introduce some notation for specific parts of triangles.
All of following notation is for $\triangle ABC$.

1. Lengths of sides of triangles: $a = |BC|$, $b = |CA|$, $c = |AB|$.
2. Angles of triangle: $\alpha = \sphericalangle A$, $\beta = \sphericalangle B$, $\gamma = \sphericalangle C$.
3. Measures of angles of a
   triangle: $\alpha = |\sphericalangle A|$, $\beta = |\sphericalangle B|$, $\gamma = |\sphericalangle C|$.
4. Bisector of any of the three angles of a triangle is called a **bisector**
   of that angle. The length of a bisector starting in vertex $A$ is denoted with $b_A$
   (and when it doesn't lead to ambiguities the bisector itself).
5. Segment connecting vertex $A$ with the middle $A_1$ of opposite side $\overline{AB}$
   is called a **median** of that triangle led from vertex $A$. It's length is denoted
   with $m_A$, (and when it doesn't lead to ambiguities the median itself is denoted in this way).
6. Consider projection $C'$ of point $C$ on line $AB$. The segment $\overline{CC'}$
   is the **height** of triangle led from vertex $C$ and is denoted with $h_{C}$.
